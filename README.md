# digit recognition
The purpose of this repository is to perform image recognition using Convolutional neural network.
## dependencies
1. python interpreter (https://www.python.org)
2. open-cv (www.opencv.org)
3. tensorflow (www.tensorflow.org)
4. os (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
5. pygame (www.pygame.org)
## how does it work?
The dataset i used in order to perform training is the mnist dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist). </br>
the neural network architecture is constructed by 2 sets of 2D Convolutional layer and max pooling 2D. </br>
